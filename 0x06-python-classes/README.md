# Python - Classes and Objects

Python is an object oriented programming language. 
Unlike procedure oriented programming, where the main emphasis is on functions, object oriented programming stresses on objects.

An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. 
Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.
